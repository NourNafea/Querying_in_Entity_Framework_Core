### ðŸ”´ Eager Loading
###### Entity Framework Core supports eager loading of related entities, same as EF 6, using the `Include()` extension method and projection query. In addition to this, it also provides the `ThenInclude()` extension method to load multiple levels of related entities.
`FirstOrDefault()`  Returns first element of a sequence, or a default value if no element is found. It throws an error Only if the source is null.
